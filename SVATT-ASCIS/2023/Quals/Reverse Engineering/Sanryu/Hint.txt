What? This three-headed dragon was not designed to be here.

You are supposed to meet this dragon at the next round of the competition but he've respawned earlier than I expected. Becareful, he's dangerous...

This is not a hint , just a small note left by a brave warrior.

------------------------
Deep down in assembly codes, there's a way to find the secret dll which contained a simple math to get the second part of the license. In this part, I've already given you one character for free :D
--------------------------
There's a weak hash string which can be easily found on the internet, that's 3 final characters of the secret license. Goodluck.
